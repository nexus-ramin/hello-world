# hello-world
A brief introduction about me
Hello, My name is Ramin and I have been fascinated by technology and computers all my life. My biggest passion is playing video games,
but I'm also very curious about how things work, and this curiousity lead me down a rabbit hole, where i ultimately found python and created my first program.
to many, printing "hello world" might be a menial task, but for me, it was a big deal and I instantly got hooked.
I've been learning python since January of 2022 so I'm very new but hopefully one day, I'll be good enough to secure a good job and support my family.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.
You are awesome!
